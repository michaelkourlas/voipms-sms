# VoIP.ms SMS #

## Overview ##

VoIP.ms SMS is an Android application that sends and receives SMS messages using a VoIP.ms account.

## Features ##

Many people use VoIP.ms as an alternative to a voice plan on mobile devices. Unfortunately, this can make texting 
rather difficult, as the VoIP.ms SMS Message Center is built for desktop browsers and is difficult to navigate and use 
on a mobile device. While VoIP.ms does provide a [mobile version](https://sms.voip.ms/) of this interface, they do not 
provide a dedicated mobile application, depriving users of important features like push notifications and contacts
synchronization.

VoIP.ms SMS is an Android application that fixes this problem by allowing you to send and receive SMS messages using 
your VoIP.ms account. The application's features include:

* The ability to send, receive, and delete texts;
* Conversation-based organization (all texts to and from a particular phone number are grouped together);
* Synchronization with device contacts, including the contact's name and photo; and
* Push notifications when new texts are received using [VoIP.ms SMS Server](https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-server).

## Installation ##

The application is available from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kourlas.voipms_sms) 
and from the [Releases section](https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/releases) of the GitHub repository.
