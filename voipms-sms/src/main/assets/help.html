<h1>Application Setup</h1>

<p>Before using this application, please ensure that you have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>enabled API access for your VoIP.ms account;</li>
    <li>set an API password (which is <strong>distinct</strong> from your account password); and</li>
    <li>set a list of approved IP addresses (or "0.0.0.0" to allow access from any IP address).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make changes to VoIP.ms API settings <a href="https://www.voip.ms/m/api.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>When signing into this application, please use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the email address you use to sign into the VoIP.ms portal (<strong>not</strong> your SIP username); and</li>
    <li>the API password which you set above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Push Notifications</h2>

<p>This application supports push notifications using Google Cloud Messaging. To enable push notifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>make sure your device is connected to the Internet, then enable notifications in Settings; and</li>
    <li>access the SMS settings for your DID on the VoIP.ms portal and enable the \'SMS URL Callback\' feature,
        entering the following URL into the neighbouring field: <a
                href="http://voipmssms-kourlas.rhcloud.com/sms_callback?did={TO}">http://voipmssms-kourlas.rhcloud.com/sms_callback?did={TO}</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>You can make changes to VoIP.ms DID settings <a href="https://voip.ms/m/managedid.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>When push notifications are enabled, the application stores your DID and GCM registration ID on a server run by the
    developer. When your DID receives a text message, VoIP.ms will send a callback to the server. The server will then
    forward the callback to your device using Google Cloud Messaging.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy, the server <strong>only</strong> links DIDs with GCM registration IDs and tells your
    device when to sync with the VoIP.ms servers. It does not process or store the text of individual SMSes.</p>
